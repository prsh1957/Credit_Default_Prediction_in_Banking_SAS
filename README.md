# Credit_Default_Prediction_in_Banking_SAS


Project Background: 
A credit scoring model is typically used in banking to help with the decision of whether to accept or reject a particular loan. It uses 
past information about a borrower(late payments, no of loans, education etc.) and gives an estimate of the probability of defaults.

Objective: 
The goal is to determine the ability of different factors such as borrowerâ€™s age, education, occupation, gender etc. to drive the behaviour of Loan Default which can be used in a risk assessment of new clients as well as in monitoring a health score of existing clients.

Available Data: 
Data for about 150,000 clients in 17 different categories.                                                                            

Scope: 
To build a logistic regression model for NPA (Non-performing Asset) status as a dependent variable with 16 independent variables 
like income, age etc., determine which factors are the driving factors for default and prepare a report on possible insights.
